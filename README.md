# Welcome to my activity!

In this project on Git and github, I share you my activity on the course "Learn to code with Javascript";

## What we have to do was : 

>We ought to build a program to manage a user's contacts in a JavaScriptfile called `contacts.js`.

* To start, get and unzip basic program structure. It contains a directory called activity_2 which includes the contacts.js and contacts.html files, already linked to one another.

* Each contact should have a first and last name. The program will handle an array of contacts and offer the user a choice of the two features:

  **View each contact
  **Quit

*The program should run until the user chooses to exit. It must also use objects to manage contacts.

*Two initial contacts to put in the program were:
	*John Smith
	*Jane Doe
*To get maximum points, we add the ability for the user to enter a new contact that will be inserted in the table!*


Thank you :)
